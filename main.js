const example1 = [
  {name: 'Tom', favColor: 'Blue'},
  {name: 'Ann', favColor: 'Red'},
  {name: 'Karl', favColor: 'Pink'}

//     How would you make Karl's favorite color into a variable in the simplest way possible?



//     How would we a whole object into a variable?



const example2 = {
  car: {
    make: 'Geo',
    model: 'Prizm',
    weight: [1802, 2130, 3652],
    fuelV: 10,

  },
  driver: {

//     How would we use destructuring to create a varible for the car's weight capacity (3652)?



//     How could we use destructuring to calculate mpg?



//     How would we use destructuring to create a function which returns a string describing who is driving the car?
